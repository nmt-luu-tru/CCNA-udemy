### Introduction to Networking

If you're already familiar with switches, routers, and network topology, you can skip ahead to the next lesson. However, if you're new to networking, hereâ€™s a quick overview to get you started.

### Setting Up a Local Area Network (LAN)

Imagine an office in New York for our company. In this office, we have end hosts such as PCs, a server, and a printer. These devices need to communicate with each other, so we introduce a network switch. The switch connects the devices using Ethernet cables, allowing them to communicate within the Local Area Network (LAN). Additionally, a Wireless Access Point (WAP) is connected to the switch, enabling wireless devices, such as laptops, to join the LAN.

### Introducing the Router

The devices in our New York office can now communicate with each other, forming a LAN. However, they also need to communicate with devices on the Internet. For this, a router is required. A router can make advanced routing decisions, directing traffic between different areas of the network, hence its name. Although similar in appearance to a switch, a router has fewer physical ports and can support different types of connections.

### Securing the Network with a Firewall

To protect our network from potential threats, such as hackers, a firewall is essential. A firewall secures different parts of the network from each other, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented. While network devices like switches, routers, and firewalls may look similar, each serves a unique purpose.

### Expanding the Network to Multiple Locations

Our example company has another office in Boston, with a similar setup to the New York office, including a LAN and Internet connectivity. To enable communication between the New York and Boston offices, we can establish a Wide Area Network (WAN). This can be done by either setting up secure communication over the Internet or installing a dedicated connection between the routers in both offices.

### Overview of Network Characteristics

The primary goal of networking is to enable connectivity between different end hosts. Several characteristics define a network:

- **Topology**: The arrangement of devices and how they are connected. A network topology diagram visually represents this structure.
  
- **Speed and Cost**: The faster the network, the higher the cost, influenced by the type of devices, network size, and technologies used.

- **Security**: While the firewall provides security, additional security features can be implemented on routers, switches, and through devices like Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

- **Availability**: To ensure mission-critical components are always operational, redundancy is necessary. This prevents single points of failure from disrupting the network.

- **Scalability**: The network should be designed to accommodate growth without requiring a redesign.

- **Reliability**: The network must be dependable, continuing to function as intended over time.

This overview introduces the essential elements of networking, laying the foundation for more advanced topics.
